For each page either proofread or validated the participant gain points. At the end of the contest, a prize is awarded to the Wikisourceror with the most points. Second and third-place prize are awarded with a random drawing from all the remaining contestants: each point that you gained during the contest is like a lottery ticket, so the more points you have gained during the contest (that is, the more pages you have proofread or validated), the more chances you have to win.",
